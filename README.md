# Elm-Hash

Generate unique hash ids for arbitrary data structures. This library allows you to create a unique id for only the elements of the hash that are relevant to the uniqueness of the data. This library also lets you create order dependent and order independent hashing.

## Order Dependent Hashing

Most implementations will probably use order dependent hashing.

## Order Independent Hashing

In the off chance that you want two variables to be interchangeable, you can make the hash order independent.
